# selectable_text_toolbar_example

 Example of custom text selection options in a Flutter application. So far the API for this is a bit wonky, which forces us to create a custom class MyMaterialTextSelectionControls.

 Huge thanks to [justinmc, the developer who is working to improve this API]([https://link](https://github.com/justinmc/flutter-text-selection-menu-examples))
